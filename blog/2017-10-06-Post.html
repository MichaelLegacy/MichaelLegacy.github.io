              Recently I was watching a video online where a man was asked a question about how he found success and how to become successful.
              He started off by saying,
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              If there was any advice I could give you in the next two minutes that would make you successful, then I could give that advice to everybody and they would be successful. Success isn't easy to find.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              This is rather obvious once you stop to think for a second. Most people have goals in their lives, and most people can come up with a plan to achieve those goals. The hard part is following through.
              In other words, the biggest barrier to success is contentedness. Some people are content with how their lives are and don't put in any effort to change, other's however are not 100% content but also do not put in any effort to change.
              These people will have trouble meeting their goals and be unsatisfied with life.
            </p>
            <p>
              The last group of people have goals and put in effort to meet them. These people will be and are successful. From these three groupings, we can see group one is content with their life, while group two and three are not.
              We'll ignore group one for the rest of this post and look more into groupings two and three. 
              A person in group two and a person in group three are very similar in many ways. They both have goals, they both often have a good idea of how to achieve it or what to do to get closer to their goals. The key difference being effort.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'll admit that at one point I was a member of group two, and sometimes I still feel like I am. One of my goals now is to be able to classify myself in group three, not content and working hard toward my goals.
              Those goals can be generally grouped into a few categories, and I'll talk about how I intend to fulfill them below.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">School</h2>
            <p>
              Like most other students I know, I have the goal to do well in school. Recently I will admit that I have not been doing well. What this indicates to me is that my process and mindset for tackling schoolwork needs changed.  
            </p>
            <p>
              The first thing I needed to change was my goals. Previously I had looked at graduation requirements and noted that there was a minimum average required. As well as for specific courses, a minimum average required to take them.
              I would say I was definitely quite lazy and would try to do the bare minimum needed. This ended up with me skipping a few assignments, studying as little as possible until I realized it was too little, and other not recomended things.
            </p>
            <p>
              After a bit of a slap in the face with some course results, I've moved my goals higher and taken some steps to help meet them. A few key things I do now that I was not doing previously are
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Treat school like a full time job. Spend at least 5 hours a day on campus or working on school related tasks.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Better planning. Marked down all important due dates at the start of the term and began using <a style="text-decoration: underline" href="http://trello.com">Trello</a> to organize my weekly tasks.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Location management. At home I can be distracted easier than in the library or a more isolated place.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
              I've been able to turn this into a fairly strong routine so far this school term, and hope I can continue to follow through be successful in the coming months.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Projects</h2>
            <p>Working on personal programming projects is something that I also like to do with my spare time. I think its safe to separate this from schoolwork as it's more of a career focused section. Developing practical on skills will be very helpful for me as I advance my career.
              Being motivated to work on these rather than relax after a long day at work (school in my case) is a skill I am still working on. I have a few good ideas for projects, and have undergone a fairly thorough planning phase but have yet to implement them fully.
              I think I'll write about this process more in a future blog post. And while I'm not sure how many people will be reading this, if you're interested, check back in a couple weeks for that.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>In short, I've begun making progress to becoming a stronger student by becoming a more organized and focused individual while avoiding distraction. Seems rather obvious when I put it that way, but as we all know it really isn't that simple.</p>
