                    <p>
                       Recently I was watching a video online where a man was asked a question about how he found success and how to become successful.
                       He started off by saying,
                    </p>

                       <blockquote>If there was any advice I could give you in the next two minutes that would make you successful, then I could give that advice to everybody and they would be successful. Success isn't easy to find.</blockquote>
                    <p>
                      This is rather obvious once you stop to think for a second. Most people have goals in their lives, and most people can come up with a plan to achieve those goals. The hard part is following through.
                      In other words, the biggest barrier to success is contentedness. Some people are content with how their lives are and don't put in any effort to change, other's however are not 100% content but also do not put in any effort to change.
                      These people will have trouble meeting their goals and be unsatisfied with life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The last group of people have goals and put in effort to meet them. These people will be and are successful. From these three groupings, we can see group one is content with their life, while group two and three are not.
                      We'll ignore group one for the rest of this post and look more into groupings two and three. 
                      A person in group two and a person in group three are very similar in many ways. They both have goals, they both often have a good idea of how to achieve it or what to do to get closer to their goals. The key difference being effort.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I'll admit that at one point I was a member of group two, and sometimes I still feel like I am. One of my goals now is to be able to classify myself in group three, not content and working hard toward my goals.
